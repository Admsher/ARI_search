DeMille has wrought from Wilson Barrett's famous old stage work, \"\"The Sign of the Cross.\"\" It was offered last night at the Rialto before a brilliant audience, which revealed no little interest in its variety of handsome scenes, its battling gladiators, its orgies in Nero's court, its chanting Christians, its music and its screams.Throughout this really mammoth production the fine DeMillean hand is noticeable. Where there was a chance to touch up episodes it has been done. It is as though Nero were living in the twentieth century, with some of the lines and the squabbling in the Rome arena for places to see the big bill, which includes many combats between Nero's own subjects and scores of Christians and others marching to their deaths. The hungry lions rush up stone steps, eager to get to their human prey, and, just before that, a dying man is supposed to have his head trampled on by an elephant.The principal r√¥les are all well played, even though they are more or less in the modern manner.
