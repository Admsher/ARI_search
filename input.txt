Comparisonvalue2:It is undoubtedly an opulent and striking pictorial spectacle that Cecil B. DeMille has wrought from Wilson Barrett's famous old stage work, "The Sign of the Cross." It was offered last night at the Rialto before a brilliant audience, which revealed no little interest in its variety of handsome scenes, its battling gladiators, its orgies in Nero's court, its chanting Christians, its music and its screams.Throughout this really mammoth production the fine DeMillean hand is noticeable. Where there was a chance to touch up episodes it has been done. It is as though Nero were living in the twentieth century, with some of the lines and the squabbling in the Rome arena for places to see the big bill, which includes many combats between Nero's own subjects and scores of Christians and others marching to their deaths. The hungry lions rush up stone steps, eager to get to their human prey, and, just before that, a dying man is supposed to have his head trampled on by an elephant.The principal rôles are all well played, even though they are more or less in the modern manner. But the outstanding histrionic achievement comes from Charles Laughton, who shoulders the responsibility for Nero. He is a petulent Nero, a man who has no thought for other than himself, and when he is asked to grant the life of Mercia, acted by Elissa Landi, he begs not to be delayed any further or he will be late for the games. He sucks the fruit juice from his fingers as he watches men die, and most casually he puts his thumb down on a request for mercy, Nero looks as if he had adenoids and his voice is unmistakably English of the present day. But what matters that? It is a remarkable performance of the fiddling Emperor as Laughton sees him; perhaps quite a restrained piece of acting, considering what is generally known of this creature.Nero likes his poetry and his lyre. He is always ready to yawn, particularly when bored by demands for the lives of Christian prisoners. He rolls about on his great throne, never showing any vigor, except possibly once, when Marcus Superbus defies him. But that is only for a flash. He is fat and flabby and his royal robes always appear to be in the way. He is the antithesis to the smart Marcus, acted admirably by Fredric March, who, if his diction constantly reminds one of his impersonation of Dr. Jekyll and other rôles, wears his Roman uniform as if to the manner born.No De Mille picture would be complete without some suggestion of a bathtub, and here this director goes himself one better by having a small swimming pool filled with the milk from asses. It is the wont of Nero's wife, Poppaea, to revel in this pool and, as another touch from the master of Hollywood, one beholds first one cat and then another beside the pool lapping up milk. If Wilson Barrett could only have seen it!Another animal touch, which is reminiscent of one in Mr. de Mille's "King of Kings," is that of having Poppaea on a lounge, while nearby is a leopard.Here one moment one sees Nero, enjoying his food, then one perceives a gladiator receiving the coup de grace, and subsequently one hears the Christians awaiting death declaiming the Sermon on the Mount or the Twenty-third Psalm. It is a constant mingling of religion, lust and blood. And for Mr. De Mille there must be realism when it comes to deaths in the arena, although he does spare the spectator's feelings toward the end by leaving to their imagination the general attacks of the lions on the singing Christians. Before that, however, there are scenes of one man struggling with a tiger.This picture is staged impressively and finely photographed. There is an abundance of imagination throughout its scenes and the story is well told. One feels, however, that the players must have been relieved when the Production was finished, for all work bard and thoroughly, even to those who merely figure for an instant or so in a death scene in the arena or the more fortunate who are spatting about their seats.Elissa Landi is restrained and graceful as Mercia. Miss Colbert is capital as the seductive Empress who is enamored of the handsome Marcus. Ian Keith is splendid as the snarling Tigellinus, who is jealous of Marcus's favor with Nero. Ferdinand Gottschalk does effective work as Glabrio and Harry Beresford makes the most of the rôle of Flavius. As a facial help in his impersonation of Nero, Mr. Laughton has a specially made-up Roman nose.THE SIGN OF THE CROSS, based on Wilson Barrett's play; directed by Cecil B.
